                            <li><strong>games</strong><br>  
                                When you select this command, you’ll be presented with a list of some of the most famous chess grandmasters.<br>

                                displayed, and the solution can be revealed below in a spoiler format.<br>Currently, there are 11 puzzles available, 
                                but more will be added in the future (note that some puzzles may repeat).</li><br>

                            <li><strong>history</strong><br>  
                                Selecting this command will display a list of centuries.<br>By clicking on a century, you will receive a brief overview

                                By selecting this command, you will be sent one of 10 quotes from 5 different grandmasters.<br>The list of quotes will 
                                grow over time (some quotes may repeat).</li><br>

                            <li><strong>learning</strong><br>

                                After selecting this command, you will need to press the "Start" button to begin.<br>From there, you can navigate through 
                                11 basic chess topics using buttons. The next button may not disappear properly, but I’m working on fixing this issue 
                                in the near future.</li><br>

                            <li><strong>dictionary</strong>  
                                When you select this command, you will be asked to enter a letter (uppercase or lowercase).<br>You will then receive chess 
                                terms that begin with that letter. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with chess terminology.</li>

                            <li>The "puzzles" command does not work repeatedly if you press the 'Yes' button. 
                                    To receive a new puzzle, you will need to select the 'puzzles' command again.</li>
                                <br><br>
                            <li>Sometimes the answer doesn't always appear in the puzzle command, but I am working on fixing this issue.</li>
                            <br><br>
                            <li>A similar situation occurs with the 'dictionary' command. If you try to enter a letter again, the bot may not respond at all, 
                                requiring you to access the dictionary command again to continue using it.</li>
                            <br><br>
                            <li>Measures will be taken to improve this functionality in the dictionary soon.</li>
