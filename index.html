            <ol>
                <li><strong>games</strong><br>  
                    When you select this command, you’ll be presented with a list of some of the most famous chess grandmasters.<br>
                    Clicking on any of their names will provide you with links to all their available games on chess.com.<br>This is 
                    a great way to explore and learn from legendary players.</li><br>

                <li><strong>books</strong><br>  
                    Selecting this command will send you a list of currently relevant chess books.<br>These are up-to-date resources 
                    to help you improve your understanding of the game,<br>from openings to advanced strategy.</li><br>

                <li><strong>puzzles</strong><br>  
                    By selecting this command, you will receive a random chess puzzle.<br>At the top, the theme of the puzzle will be 
                    displayed, and the solution can be revealed below in a spoiler format.<br>Currently, there are 11 puzzles available, 
                    but more will be added in the future (note that some puzzles may repeat).</li><br>

                <li><strong>history</strong><br>  
                    Selecting this command will display a list of centuries.<br>By clicking on a century, you will receive a brief overview 
                    of chess history from that period.<br>It's a great way to learn how the game evolved over time.</li><br>

                <li><strong>recommendations</strong><br>  
                    When you select this command, you’ll receive beginner-friendly recommendations on how to improve your chess skills.<br>
                    These tips are designed to help new players get started and develop a solid foundation.</li><br>

                <li><strong>quotes</strong><br>  
                    By selecting this command, you will be sent one of 10 quotes from 5 different grandmasters.<br>The list of quotes will 
                    grow over time (some quotes may repeat).</li><br>

                <li><strong>learning</strong><br>  
                    Selecting this command will provide you with links to 4 YouTube playlists that I have personally curated.<br>Each playlist 
                    covers different chess topics aimed at helping you improve your game through structured lessons.</li><br>

                <li><strong>chess_basics</strong><br>  
                    After selecting this command, you will need to press the "Start" button to begin.<br>From there, you can navigate through 
                    11 basic chess topics using buttons. The next button may not disappear properly, but I’m working on fixing this issue 
                    in the near future.</li><br>

                <li><strong>dictionary</strong>  
                    When you select this command, you will be asked to enter a letter (uppercase or lowercase).<br>You will then receive chess 
                    terms that begin with that letter. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with chess terminology.</li>
            </ol><br><hr>

            <h3 id="note">Note:</h3>
            <ul id="note_text">
                <li>The "puzzles" command does not work repeatedly if you press the 'Yes' button. 
                    To receive a new puzzle, you will need to select the 'puzzles' command again.</li>
                    <br><br>
                <li>Sometimes the answer doesn't always appear in the puzzle command, but I am working on fixing this issue.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li>A similar situation occurs with the 'dictionary' command. If you try to enter a letter again, the bot may not respond at all, 
                    requiring you to access the dictionary command again to continue using it.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li>Measures will be taken to improve this functionality in the dictionary soon.</li>
            </ul>
